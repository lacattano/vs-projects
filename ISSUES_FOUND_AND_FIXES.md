# AI-Playwright-Test-Generator - Issues Found and Fixes

## Overview
This document tracks issues identified in the `AI-Playwright-Test-Generator` repository and the fixes applied. Issues are categorized by type and include the root cause analysis, solution implemented, and impact of each fix.

---

## Issues Identified

### 1. **GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline** ⚠️
**Problem:** The GitHub Actions workflow badge was not properly configured for the renamed project.

**Root Cause:** The repository reference in the CI/CD badge was outdated.

**Fix:** Updated the CI/CD pipeline badge to reflect the renamed project repository:
```yaml
[![CI/CD Pipeline](https://github.com/lacattano/AI-Playwright-Test-Generator/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lacattano/AI-Playwright-Test-Generator/actions)
```

**Impact:** The CI/CD status badge now correctly displays for the `AI-Playwright-Test-Generator` project.

---

### 2. **Path Calculation Problem** ⚠️
**Problem:** The application was calculating paths incorrectly, looking for files in the wrong directory.

**Root Cause:** The path calculation used `Path(__file__).parent.parent` which goes up two levels from the script location, assuming it was in a `src/` subdirectory relative to the project root. However, the path traversal was inconsistent and broke when running from different directories.

**Fix:** Changed to use `Path.cwd()` (current working directory) instead:
```python
GENERATED_TESTS_DIR = Path.cwd() / "generated_tests"
MOCK_SITE_DIR = Path.cwd() / "generated_tests"
```

**Impact:** Users can run the script from any directory and it will correctly find the `generated_tests/` folder relative to where they ran the command.

---

### 3. **Pytest Import in Generated Tests** ⚠️
**Problem:** The LLM was generating tests with `import pytest` in the generated code, but the tests were designed to run standalone with Playwright, not with pytest.

**Root Cause:** The original prompt template didn't explicitly tell the LLM to exclude pytest imports. Playwright tests can run either standalone (without pytest) or with pytest - the LLM chose the pytest variant by default.

**Fix:** Updated the prompt to explicitly instruct the LLM:
```
1. ONLY use `from playwright.sync_api import Page, expect` - DO NOT import pytest.
   - The test will run standalone or with Playwright's built-in runner.
```

**Impact:** Generated tests are now standalone Playwright tests that don't require pytest as a dependency.

---

### 4. **LLM Prompt Structure** ⚠️
**Problem:** The original prompt was too verbose and used XML tags that the LLM might not properly respect.

**Fix:** Restructured the prompt to be more direct and explicit:
- Clear numbered requirements
- Explicit "DO NOT" instructions for unwanted behavior
- Example code structure provided
- Emphasis on Playwright-specific APIs

---

### 5. **Markdown Code Fence Parsing** ⚠️
**Problem:** The LLM outputs markdown code fences (````) around the generated code, and the parser wasn't handling them consistently.

**Fix:** Enhanced the cleaning logic to:
- Detect and skip markdown fences (```python`, ```, etc.)
- Auto-detect when the code block starts by looking for Python-specific patterns
- Strip remaining fence characters from beginning and end

---

### 6. **CLI Output Formatting** ⚠️
**Problem:** The CLI output was minimal and didn't provide clear visual hierarchy or status indicators.

**Fix:** Improved formatting with:
- Separator lines and headers
- Emoji icons for visual cues (🚀, ✅, ❌, 🧠, etc.)
- Clearer option menus
- Better error messages with context

---

### 7. **CLI Module Architecture** 🆕
**Problem:** The original project lacked a proper CLI interface with command handling, argument parsing, and structured output.

**Root Cause:** The project only had an interactive menu-based approach without programmatic command-line support.

**Fix:** Implemented a complete CLI module with:
- `argparse` for command and argument parsing
- Command sub-commands: `generate`, `test`, `help`
- Configuration classes: `AnalysisMode`, `ReportFormat` enums
- Modular components: `InputParser`, `UserStoryAnalyzer`, `TestCaseOrchestrator`, `EvidenceGenerator`, `ReportGenerator`
- Support for multiple input formats: text, user story, Gherkin, JSON

**Impact:** The tool now supports both interactive and programmatic usage, making it suitable for CI/CD pipelines and automation workflows.

---

### 8. **Output Directory Argument Mismatch** 🆕
**Problem:** The CLI parser used `--output` for argument name but the handler expected `output_dir`.

**Root Cause:** Inconsistent naming between the argparse definition and the function parameters.

**Fix:** Used `dest="output_dir"` in the argument parser to map `--output` to the `output_dir` parameter:
```python
gen_parser.add_argument("--output", "-o", type=str, default="generated_tests", dest="output_dir",
                      help="Output directory")
```

**Impact:** The CLI now correctly accepts the `--output` argument and passes it to the generation functions.

---

### 9. **Report Format LOCAL Not Implemented** 🆕
**Problem:** The `ReportFormat.LOCAL` enum value was defined but the corresponding save method was not implemented.

**Root Cause:** Incomplete implementation of the `save_test_cases` method in `ReportGeneratorBase`.

**Fix:** Implemented `_save_local` method to generate both JSON and XML reports:
```python
def _save_local(self) -> Path:
    """Generate JSON and XML reports for local consumption."""
    json_path = self._generate_json_report()
    xml_path = self._generate_xml_report()
    return Path(json_path)
```

**Impact:** All report formats are now fully functional, including local JSON and XML exports for CI/CD integration.

---

### 10. **Missing parse_json Method** 🆕
**Problem:** The `InputParser` class lacked a method to parse JSON-formatted test case input.

**Root Cause:** Only the `parse` method existed, which handled text-based inputs.

**Fix:** Added `parse_json` method:
```python
def parse_json(self, json_string: str) -> ParsedInput:
    """Parse JSON string into ParsedInput."""
    data = json.loads(json_string)
    test_cases = []
    for item in data.get("test_cases", []):
        test_cases.append(TestCase(
            title=item.get("title", "Untitled"),
            description=item.get("description", ""),
            complexity=item.get("complexity", "MEDIUM"),
            priority=item.get("priority", 1)
        ))
    return ParsedInput(test_cases=test_cases, metadata=data.get("metadata", {}))
```

**Impact:** Users can now provide JSON-formatted test case definitions directly to the CLI.

---

### 11. **Class Name Inconsistency** 🆕
**Problem:** The module imported `EvidenceGenerator` but the class was named `EvidenceGen`.

**Root Cause:** Typo/renaming inconsistency in the evidence generator module.

**Fix:** Ensured consistent class naming:
```python
from cli.evidence_generator import EvidenceGenerator
```

**Impact:** Imports now work correctly without `AttributeError`.

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test path handling:** Run the script from different directories to ensure it correctly finds `generated_tests/`
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Test LLM generation:** Generate a test and verify it doesn't include pytest imports

3. **Test mock server:** Run the mock server and verify the HTML file loads correctly
   ```bash
   python main.py  # Then select option 3
   ```

4. **Run a test:** Generate a test and run it against the mock site
   ```bash
   cd generated_tests
   pytest test_example.py
   ```

5. **Test CLI commands:**
   ```bash
   python -m cli.main help
   python -m cli.main generate --input "Login test"
   python -m cli.main test --filter login
   ```

6. **Test report generation:**
   ```bash
   python -m cli.main generate --input "Test" --reports all
   ls -la generated_tests/
   ```

7. **Test JSON input:**
   ```bash
   echo '{"test_cases": [{"title": "Test", "description": "Test desc", "complexity": "LOW"}]}' | python -m cli.main generate --format json
   ```

---

## Next Steps for Improvement

1. **Add more test patterns:** Include common Playwright patterns like:
   - `page.wait_for_selector()` for loading states
   - `page.route()` for API mocking examples
   - Network failure handling

2. **Add documentation:** Create a `PROMPT_EXAMPLES.md` file showing how to craft good feature descriptions

3. **Add error handling:** More robust handling of network errors, Ollama connection issues

4. **Add configuration:** Allow users to specify their own Ollama model, timeout settings, etc.

5. **Add unit tests:** Comprehensive test coverage for CLI components

6. **Add integration tests:** End-to-end testing of the entire workflow

## Pre-commit Configuration (March 4, 2026)

### 12. **Pre-commit Configuration for Ruff** 🆕
**Problem:** The `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file was missing and needed to be created to enable automated linting and formatting checks before commits.

**Root Cause:** No pre-commit configuration existed in the repository, requiring manual code quality checks.

**Fix:** Created `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with the following configuration:
```yaml
# pre-commit configuration for ruff
# - ruff: linting and auto-fixes
# - ruff-format: code formatting
#
# To run: pre-commit run
# To install: pre-commit install
#
# Note: generated_tests/ is excluded from checks
exclude: ^generated_tests/

repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
    rev: v0.9.0
    hooks:
      - id: ruff
        args: [--fix]
      - id: ruff-format
```

**CLI Code Quality Fixes Applied:**
- **cli/evidence_generator.py**: Fixed F841 (unused variable `unused_var`), removed W291 trailing whitespace
- **cli/input_parser.py**: Fixed F841 (unused variable `title`)
- **cli/story_analyzer.py**: Fixed C403 (converted list comprehension to generator expression)
- **cli/test_orchestrator.py**: Fixed B007 (added missing second argument in `sleep()` call), removed W293 trailing whitespace, updated UP032 (f-string for date formatting)

**GitHub Actions Update:**
- Removed `--fix` flag from the `ruff check` command in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to prevent CI failures when auto-fixes are available

**Impact:** 
- Automated code quality checks now run before every commit
- Auto-fixes are applied automatically for common issues
- Code formatting is enforced consistently across the project
- Generated test files are excluded from checks to avoid unnecessary processing

**Usage:**
```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Run pre-commit on all files
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run pre-commit on changed files only
pre-commit run
```
